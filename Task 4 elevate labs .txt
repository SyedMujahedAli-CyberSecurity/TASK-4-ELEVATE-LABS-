Task 4 — Setup and Use a Firewall on Windows
Student: Syed Mujahed Ali
Project: Task 4 Elevate labs  — Setup and Use a Firewall on Windows
 Tools: Windows 10/11, Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security, Command Prompt, Telnet Client (for testing)


Objective
Configure and test basic firewall rules on Windows to block and then remove a rule for a specific port (Telnet — TCP 23). Demonstrate understanding of inbound/outbound rules and how a firewall filters traffic.


Activities and Implementation
1. Open Firewall Configuration Tool
* Action: Opened Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.

* How: Pressed Win + R, typed wf.msc, and pressed Enter.


2. List Current Firewall Rules
   * Action: Navigated to Inbound Rules and Outbound Rules to review existing rules 
   * How: Left panel → Inbound Rules 
3. Add a Rule to Block Inbound Traffic on Port 23 (Telnet)
   * Action: Created a new inbound rule to block TCP port 23.

   * Steps followed (GUI):

      1. In Inbound Rules → clicked New Rule… on the right pane.

      2. Selected Port → Next.

      3. Selected TCP and entered 23 in Specific local ports → Next.

      4. Selected Block the connection → Next.

      5. Applied to Domain, Private, Public → Next.

      6. Named the rule: Block Telnet Port 23 → Finish.
4. Test the Block Rule
         * Action: Verified that the Telnet connection to localhost on port 23 was blocked.

         * Methods used:

            * Enabled Telnet Client (Control Panel → Programs → Turn Windows features on or off → Telnet Client).
Command Prompt test: telnet localhost 23
result: connection failed / could not open connection to host. 




5. (Skipped) Add Rule to Allow SSH (Port 22)
            * Note: Step 5 in the original task mentions allowing SSH (port 22) — this is specific to Linux/UFW. Since this task was completed on Windows, this step was intentionally skipped.

6. Remove the Test Block Rule
               * Action: Removed the test rule to restore original state.

               * How: In Inbound Rules, right-clicked Block Telnet Port 23 → Delete → confirmed deletion.
7. Documented GUI Steps / Commands Used
GUI steps (summary):
                  1. Win + R → wf.msc → Enter.

                  2. Inbound Rules → New Rule → Port → TCP → 23 → Block the connection → Domain/Private/Public → Name & Finish.

                  3. Test via Telnet 
                  4. Delete test rule.
8. How the Firewall Filters Traffic (Summary)
A firewall enforces a set of rules to allow or deny network traffic. Each incoming or outgoing packet/connection attempt is evaluated against the rule set. If the packet matches an allow rule it is permitted; if it matches a block rule it is dropped or rejected. Rules can be based on port, protocol (TCP/UDP), IP addresses, application path, and network profile (Domain/Private/Public). Proper rule configuration restricts exposure of services, reduces attack surface, and helps prevent unauthorized access.
